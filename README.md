# XRAccessibility Project Overview
The XRAccessibility Project is an initiative driven by the XR Association and XR Access to provide a central place for developers to find solutions for creating accessible code across various XR platforms. We were inspired by developers, key players in ensuring that this technology is accessible, who reported challenges in finding accessible code snippets. Here are some of its features:

 - Provides **strategies, code, and tutorials** to solve accessibility
   concerns across a wide range of platforms 

 - Includes an **index** that points to resources all over the internet, organized by platform
   
  - **Validates** resource usability and functionality
 
 - Features a **contribution form** for adding links to additional resources to this project

# General Resources to Help You Get Started
If you’re new to XR and Accessibility, then check out these resources for concepts and ideas:

  

[XRA’s Developers Guide, Chapter Three](https://xra.org/research/xra-developers-guide-accessibility-and-inclusive-design/): Chapter Three is an update to XRA’s Developers Guide, a starter guide for developers designing reality-expanding experiences. This standalone update, “Accessibility & Inclusive Design in Immersive Experiences,” offers a set of industry-backed best practices for developing accessible platforms that enhance experiences for all users, not just those with disabilities.
    
[XR Access Resources](http://xraccess.org/resources/): The XR Access Initiative, whose mission is to modernize, innovate, and expand XR technologies, products, content and assistive technologies by promoting inclusive design in a diverse community, has put together a list of resources representing a sample of other accessible XR projects, and resources to help ensure that XR is accessible to all.
    
[A11yVR on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqhCc1b6Cq69eg-iYeVKOog): This channel is a compilation of videos presentations and recordings of meetups where people discuss accessibility in technology for people with disabilities that apply to XR/VR/AR.
