# XRAccessibility Project Overview
The XRAccessibility Project is an initiative driven by the [XR Association](https://xra.org/) and [XR Access](https://xraccess.org) to provide a central place for developers to find solutions for creating accessible code across various XR platforms. We were inspired by developers, key players in ensuring that this technology is accessible, who reported challenges in finding accessible code snippets. It features:

 - **Strategies, code, and tutorials** to solve accessibility concerns across a wide range of platforms

 - An **index** that points to resources all over the internet, organized by platform

  - **Validation** of resource usability and functionality

 - A [**contribution form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpJxyqTgY68ilw9dVAtHpivp2ks4TR7W7szmaC2ytLTFJ3mA/viewform?usp=sf_link) for adding additional resources to this project

## Table of Contents
1. **General Resources to Help Get You Started** - A core set of resources to introduce you to XR accessibility.
2. **Additional Accessibility Guidelines** - Further lists of accessibility guidelines and tools.
3. **Platform Solutions** - Resources on a per-platform basis.
4. **Developer Communities** - Groups you can reach out to for help with XR development and/or accessibility.
5. **Resources for Disabled Developers** - Tools to help developers with disabilites contribute to XR projects.
6. **User Testing** -  Organizations and resources focused on supporting inclusive user testing.
7. **Additional Resources** - Anything that doesn't fit into the above.

## How Do I Use This?
For now, the XR Accessibility project is a list of resources, so just go to the category that fits your needs and try out some of the links. One day we hope to host code snippets right here in this repo - if you'd like your code to be featured, reach out to info@xraccess.org!

If you don't know where to start, you can ask questions at the [XR Access Slack](https://bit.ly/xraccess-slack).

## How to Contribute

The XRAccessibility Project is **open source**. If you know of resources that other developers could benefit from, please share them!

To contribute to the XRAccessibility Project, fill out our [resources submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpJxyqTgY68ilw9dVAtHpivp2ks4TR7W7szmaC2ytLTFJ3mA/viewform?usp=sf_link).  

Submissions should preferably include a video demonstration and/or a text walk-through, so that potential users don't have to deploy a solution to understand what it does.  Suggestions will be reviewed on the basis of clarity, functionality, and usefulness.

 - **Clarity**: is it clear what the resource does? Does it come with a demo or video?

 - **Functionality**: does the resource work? Is it regularly updated and maintained?

 - **Usefulness**: does the resource provide useful code snippets or otherwise help developers?

For other comments and suggestions, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/XRAccessibility/xraccessibility.github.io/issues) using Github.
