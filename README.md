# XRAccessibility Project Overview
The XRAccessibility Project is an initiative driven by the [XR Association](https://xra.org/) and [XR Access](https://xraccess.org) to provide a central place for developers to find solutions for creating accessible code across various XR platforms. We were inspired by developers, key players in ensuring that this technology is accessible, who reported challenges in finding accessible code snippets. It features:

 - **Strategies, code, and tutorials** to solve accessibility concerns across a wide range of platforms

 - An **index** that points to resources all over the internet, organized by platform

  - **Validation** of resource usability and functionality

 - A [**contribution form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpJxyqTgY68ilw9dVAtHpivp2ks4TR7W7szmaC2ytLTFJ3mA/viewform?usp=sf_link) for adding additional resources to this project

## How to Contribute

The XRAccessibility Project is **open source**. If you know of resources that other developers could benefit from, please share them!

To contribute to the XRAccessibility Project, fill out our [resources submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpJxyqTgY68ilw9dVAtHpivp2ks4TR7W7szmaC2ytLTFJ3mA/viewform?usp=sf_link).  

Submissions should preferably include a video demonstration and/or a text walk-through, so that potential users don't have to deploy a solution to understand what it does.  Suggestions will be reviewed on the basis of clarity, functionality, and usefulness.

 - **Clarity**: is it clear what the resource does? Does it come with a demo or video?

 - **Functionality**: does the resource work? Is it regularly updated and maintained?

 - **Usefulness**: does the resource provide useful code snippets or otherwise help developers?

For other comments and suggestions, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/XRAccessibility/xraccessibility.github.io/issues) using Github.
