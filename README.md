# Project Overview

The XRAccessibility Project is an initiative driven by the [XR Association](https://xra.org/) and [XR Access](https://xraccess.org) to provide a central place for developers to find solutions for creating accessible code across various XR platforms. We were inspired by developers, key players in ensuring that this technology is accessible, who reported challenges in finding accessible code snippets. Please browse the links below. If you can't find what you're looking for or don't know where to start, you can ask questions at the [XR Access Slack](https://bit.ly/xraccess-slack).

### Contributions Welcome

The XRAccessibility Project is **open source**. If you know of resources that other developers could benefit from, please share them! To contribute to the XRAccessibility Project, fill out our [resources submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpJxyqTgY68ilw9dVAtHpivp2ks4TR7W7szmaC2ytLTFJ3mA/viewform?usp=sf_link).  

> [!NOTE]
>
> Submissions should preferably include a video demonstration and/or a text walk-through, so that potential users don't have to deploy a solution to understand what it does.  Suggestions will be reviewed on the basis of clarity, functionality, and usefulness.

For other comments and suggestions, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/XRAccessibility/xraccessibility.github.io/issues) using Github.
